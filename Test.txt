1. Schedule Optimization - Valid Schedule
Test a schedule that clearly falls within the HOS regulations.

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/scheduler/optimize/?pickup_time=2023-07-10T09:00:00&dropoff_time=2023-07-10T19:00:00&last_rest_time=2023-07-10T01:00:00"
Expected Output: {"valid": true, "message": "Schedule within HOS regulations."}

2. Schedule Optimization - Exceeds Daily Driving Limit
Test a schedule that exceeds the daily driving limit of 11 hours.


curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/scheduler/optimize/?pickup_time=2023-07-10T05:00:00&dropoff_time=2023-07-10T17:30:00&last_rest_time=2023-07-10T01:00:00"
Expected Output: {"valid": false, "message": "Exceeds 11-hour driving limit."}

3. Schedule Optimization - Exceeds 14-Hour Window

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/scheduler/hos_violation/?driving_time=9&hours_since_last_rest=3"
Expected Output: {"valid": true, "messages": []}

5. HOS Violation Detection - Violation Detected
Test the detection of a scenario where both the 11-hour limit and 14-hour limit are exceeded.


curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/scheduler/hos_violation/?driving_time=12&hours_since_last_rest=4"
Expected Output: {"valid": false, "messages": ["Driving time exceeds 11 hours.", "Total duty period exceeds 14 hours.", "Consider reducing driving hours or adding rest periods."]}
